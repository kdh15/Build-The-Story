		<div>The burger stand is always a fun place to eat lunch!  Today when we went by, there was a boy and girl eating by the big tree.  Someone forgot to clean up and they left their cup on the big rock, but that reminded me that I needed to order some food.  I ordered french fries and a hamburger and put them on the table with an umbrella. I had to be careful so the squirrel in the tree didn’t eat my food!</div>

		<div>The silly clown was always being funny!  He was standing on a ball.  He had an umbrella in one hand with a fishbowl on top of it.  In the bowl was a purple fish.  The box had a bright hat sitting on it and there was a red balloon floating above it.</div>
