</div>
		<div>The silly clown was always being funny!  He was standing on a ball.  He had an umbrella in one hand with a fishbowl on top of it.  In the bowl was a purple fish.  The box had a bright hat sitting on it and there was a red balloon floating above it.</div>
		<div>HOME</div>
		<div>Brady was thinking about some things he liked.  He liked ice cream and cake.  He liked dogs and pizza.  He did not like snakes or fish. He also liked cows and apples.</div>
		<div>Welcome to the rhyming party!  There  was a fox on a box.  There was a snake on a cake.  There was a red fish on a blue dish and a cat with a hat.  What could be on a log?</div>
		<div>Mrs. Washington went to the barn and the animals were all being very silly.   The pig was in the tub and the cow was in the mud.  The duck was eating soap! Mrs. Washington yelled to the horse to get down from the tree!
</div>
		<div>Skylar put on her bunny ears and hid some eggs around the yard.  A green one went in the nest and a blue one under the bush. She put 3 eggs under the tree that had 2 apples.  She then hid one egg in the doghouse.</div>
		<div>It was such a nice Spring day.  The birds were flying, there was a ladybug on the fence, and there was a bee on the yellow flower.  A butterfly flew over the flowers and a grasshopper was by the tree.  Hanna and Hank sat on the blanket and smiled.</div>
		<div>Kayla was enjoying collecting bugs.  She counted the bugs in her bug jar.  She had 3 bees and 2 flies.  Then she noticed 1 grasshopper in there!  How many bugs were in the jar?  Should she let them go?</div>
		<div>The farm animals were very hungry!  The horse wanted to eat 1 apple, 1 carrot and 1 cake.  The pig wanted 1 corn on the cob and 1 piece of candy.  Can you help the hungry animals?</div>
		<div>The burger stand is always a fun place to eat lunch!  Today when we went by, there was a boy and girl eating by the big tree.  Someone forgot to clean up and they left their cup on the big rock, but that reminded me that I needed to order some food.  I ordered french fries and a hamburger and put them on the table with an umbrella. I had to be careful so the squirrel in the tree didn’t eat my food!</div>
